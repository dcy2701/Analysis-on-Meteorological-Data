# Analysis-on-Meteorological-Data
In this analysis, the weather history data was given on which the analysis had to be performed.</br>
Null Hypothesis:"Has the Apparent temperature and humidity compared monthly across 10 years of the data indicate an increase due to Global warming"
And after performing all the analysis(please refer to the notebook), I arrived on the following conclusion.
We can clearly see that there is a sharp rise in temperature in the year 2009 whereas there is a fall in temperature in the year 2015. Hence we can conclude that global warming has caused uncertainty in temperature over the past 10 years while the average humidity as remained constant throughout the 10 years.
